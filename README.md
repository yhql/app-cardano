This version is an experiment to be used with the [`-fPIC` SDK](https://github.com/yhql/nanos-secure-sdk). It will only run in speculos, not on a real device.

# Cardano Ledger App

Cardano Ledger App for Ledger Nano S


## Building

### Loading the app

`make load`

Builds and loads the application into connected device. Just make sure to close the Ledger app on the device before running the command.


### Debug version

In `Makefile`, uncomment

    #DEFINE+=DEVEL
    #DEFINE+=HEADLESS

also comment out

    DEFINES += RESET_ON_CRASH

and then run `make clean load`.

### Setup

Make sure you have:
- SDK >= 2.0.0
- MCU >= 1.11

Environment setup and developer documentation is sufficiently provided in Ledgerâ€™s [Read the Docs](https://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userspace/debugging.html).

You want a debug version of the MCU firmware (but it blocks SDK firmware updates, so for the purpose of upgrading SDK, replace it temporarily with a non-debug one). Instructions for swapping MCU versions: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-dev-doc/blob/master/source/userspace/debugging.rst

### Setting udev rules

You might need to setup udev rules before your device can communicate with the system.

## Development

To learn more about development process and individual commands, [check the desing doc](doc/design_doc.md).

## Deploying

The build process is managed with [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

### Make Commands

* `load`: Load signed app onto the Ledger device
* `clean`: Clean the build and output directories
* `delete`: Remove the application from the device
* `build`: Build obj and bin api artefacts without loading
* `format`: Format source code.

See `Makefile` for list of included functions.
